- Eggs | Large, 2 | 
- Garlic | 1 tbsp | Minced
- Fresh Parsley | 2 tbsp | Chopped
- Salt | To taste | 
- Black Pepper | To taste | 
- Chicken | 1 lb, breast cutlets | 

Whisk together eggs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add chicken into the egg, rotating to evenly coat each fillet in the mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or overnight night if time allows for a deeper flavour).

Preheat oven 430°F. Lightly grease an oven tray (or baking dish) with non stick cooking oil spray; set aside.

- Breadcrumbs | Panko, 1 cup | 
- Breadcrumbs | Italian, 1/2 cup | 
- Parmesan Cheese | 1/2 cup | Grated
- Garlic Powder | 1 tsp | 

When chicken is ready for cooking, mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder together in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into the breadcrumb mixture to evenly coat.

- Olive Oil | 1/2 cup | 

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Fry chicken until golden and crispy. Just a minute or two per side.

- Shredded Cheese | Mozzarella, 8 oz | 
- Parmesan Cheese | 1/3 cup | Grated

> Pair with Italian-American Tomato Sauce

Place chicken on prepared baking tray / dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of sauce (see Italian-American Tomato Sauce recipe). Top each chicken breast with 2-3 slices of mozzarella cheese and about 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with basil or parsley.

Bake until cheese is bubbling and melted, and the chicken is completely cooked through. 5-10 minutes. Could be longer if the cuts are thick.
