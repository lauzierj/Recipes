## Instructions

Combine spice rub ingredients in a small bowl. Coat pork with spice mixture and place in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Place onion and garlic in a large (5½ quart) Dutch oven. Place pork on top of onion and garlic. Pour over any juices that may have accumulated in the bowl.

Add the cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and water to a medium bowl, stir to combine.

Pour the mixture over the pork and cover with lid.

Insert wire rack in rack position 8. Select SLOW COOK/CONVECTION and HIGH/6 hours or LOW/8 hours. Press START to preheat oven.

Once preheated, place pork in oven and cook on HIGH for 6–8 hours or LOW for 8–10 hours, until pork is tender and shreds easily.

While the pork is cooking make the homemade BBQ sauce. Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring, for 10 minutes or until smooth and combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes or until sauce has thickened and turned maroon in color. Season to taste with kosher salt. Cool completely.

Transfer the pork to a tray. Using 2 forks, shred the pork, discarding any fat and gristle. Strain the pan juices from the pork into a jug. Pour 1 cup (250ml) into a medium saucepan. Add 1 cup (250ml) of the barbecue sauce. Stir over medium heat until hot. Pour over the shredded pork, stir gently to coat.

Top the bun bases with the pulled pork, pork, jalapenos and a spoonful of the remaining barbecue sauce. Sandwich with bun tops.

Alternatively serve the pulled pork over jacket baked potatoes, in wraps or tacos.
