- Steak | 4, New York Strip | 
- Miso Paste | 2 tbsp | 
- Honey | 2 tbsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1 pinch | 
- Salt | 1 tsp | 

Combine miso, honey, black pepper and teaspoon of salt. Coat steaks with marinade and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature.

- Ginger | 2 tbsp | Minced
- Garlic | 2 tbsp | Minced
- Shallot | 2 tbsp | Minced
- Parsley | Flat Leaf, 1/4 cup | Chopped
- Cilantro | 1/4 cup | Chopped
- Olive Oil | Extra Virgin, 1/4 cup | 
- Vinegar | Rice Wine, 1/4 cup | 
- Lime | 2 | Juiced and Zested
- Salt | 1 tsp | 

In a small mixing bowl, combine ginger, garlic, shallots, parsley, cilantro, olive oil, vinegar, lime juice and zest and salt. Reserve.

Preheat the grill to medium-high heat or prepare coals. Grill steaks about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare, but your safest bet is to use an internal thermometer and cook to 130–135°F, remembering the steaks will continue to cook when removed from the grill. Once done, be sure to let them rest for at least 5 minutes.

Slice and serve with chimichurri.
