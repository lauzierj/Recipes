Then add cauliflower florets and saute for 1 to 2 mins.

- Coconut Milk | 1¼ cup | 

Pour ½ to 1 cup water or coconut milk and give a good mix.

> Young cauliflower releases lots of moisture, so be careful not to add a lot of water at one time.

Cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender but not mushy.

If needed add more water or coconut milk to bring the curry to a desired consistency.

Taste the curry and add more salt if needed.
