- Flour | 2 tbsp | 
- Sugar | Confectioners, 2 tbsp | 
- Puff Pastry | All butter, 375g | 

Mix the flour and icing sugar, and use this to dust the work surface. Roll the pastry out to make a 45 x 30cm rectangle. Roll up lengthways to create a long sausage shape.

Cut the pastry into 24 wheels, about 3/4” thick.

Roll each wheel lightly with the rolling pin to fit 2 x 12-hole non-stick fairy cake tins.

Press the pastry circles into the tins and mould into the tins to make thin cases. Chill until needed.

- Sugar | Golden caster, 250g | 
- Lemon | 2 strips | Zested
- Cinnamon | 1 stick | 

Heat the oven to 550F. Make a sugar syrup by bringing the sugar, 200ml water, lemon zest and cinnamon stick to the boil. Reduce until syrupy, allow to cool, then remove the cinnamon and lemon.

- Eggs | 2 | 
- Egg | 4 yolks | 
- Corn Flour | 50g | 

Whisk the eggs, egg yolks and cornflour until smooth in another large pan.

- Milk | Whole, 500ml | 
- Vanilla | 1 pod | Scraped

Heat the milk and vanilla pod seeds in a separate pan until just below the boil. Gradually pour the hot milk over the eggs and cornflour, then cook on a low heat, continually whisking.

Add the cooled sugar syrup to the custard and whisk until thickened slightly.

Pour the custard through a sieve. Pour into the pastry cases and bake for 15 minutes until the pastry is golden and the custard has darkened.

- Ground Cinnamon |  | To serve

Cool completely in the tins then sift over icing sugar and ground cinnamon to serve.
