In a large skillet over medium heat, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil to coat the pan.  Once the pan is hot, add the chicken in an even layer.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly browned, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring the chicken as needed.  Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate and set aside.

Drizzle another tablespoon of olive oil onto the hot skillet and add the onion, broccoli, bell pepper, carrots and mushrooms.  Cook the vegetables until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, chicken broth, honey, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, and cornstarch.  Set aside.

Once the veggies are nice and tender, add the chicken back to the pan and mix together.  Add in the garlic and cook for about 1 minute, then add in cashews and pour the teriyaki sauce over top.  Mix well, making sure everything is coated, and bring the sauce to a boil.  Turn down the heat and simmer until sauce has thickened up and everything is incorporated.

Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds, serve and enjoy!
