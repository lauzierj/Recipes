- Shrimp | Deveined, 1 lb, large | Peeled
- Olive Oil | 1/2 tbsp | 
- Chili Powder | 1 tsp | 
- Chipotle Chili Powder | 1 tsp | 
- Ground Cumin | 1 tsp | 
- Kosher Salt | 1/2 tsp | 

Rinse and pat the shrimp dry, then transfer to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with the chili powder, chipotle chili, cumin, and salt. Toss to coat evenly.

Let rest while you prepare the shrimp taco sauce and slaw.

- Yogurt | Greek, 1 cup, plain | 
- Olive Oil | 2 tbsp | 
- Garlic | 1 clove | Peeled
- Jalapeño | 1/2, small | Seeds and membranes removed
- Cilantro | 1/4 cup | Tightly packed
- Salt | Kosher, 1/4 tsp | 
- Lime | 1, large | Juice and zest

In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process the Greek yogurt, olive oil, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, lime zest, and lime juice. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.

- Cabbage | Shredded, 2 cups | 

Place the cabbage in a mixing bowl and toss with about 1/2 cup of the sauce. Add more sauce if you desire a creamier slaw, then reserve the rest of the sauce for serving.

- Olive Oil | 1/2 tbsp | 

In a large nonstick skillet over medium high, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Add the shrimp and sauté just until the shrimp is cooked through and no longer translucent in the center, about 4 minutes. Do not overcook! Transfer the shrimp immediately to a plate.

- Tortillas | 6 to 8 corn or flour | 
- Avocado | 1 | Sliced
- Lime | 1 | Cut into wedges

Heat up the tortillas in batches in a pan or wrap in foil and place in a 250 degree oven. To serve, fill the tortillas with your desired number of shrimp, then top generously with the slaw, extra sauce, a squeeze of lime juice, and any other desired toppings.
