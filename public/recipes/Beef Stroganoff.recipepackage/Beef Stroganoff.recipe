- Salt | Generous | 

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.

- Butter | 2 tbsp | 
- Flank Steak | 1 1/2 lbs | Thinly sliced
- Salt | Kosher, to taste | 
- Black Pepper | to taste | 

As your pasta water is coming to a boil, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the steak in a single layer, seasoned with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper, and let it cook undisturbed for about 3 minutes to get a good sear.

Flip the steak, and cook on the other side until browned, another 2-3 minutes. Then remove steak from pan with a slotted spoon, transfer to a clean plate, and set aside.

> If your pan is not big enough to fit all of the steak in a single layer, cook half of the steak in 1 tablespoon of butter. Then repeat with a second batch.

- Onion | White, 1, small | Thinly sliced

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the sauté pan. Once it has melted, add the onions and sauté for about 3 minutes.

- Mushrooms | Baby Bella, 1 lb | Sliced

Add mushrooms and sauté for an additional 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the mushrooms are cooked and the onions are soft.

- Garlic | 4 cloves | Minced
- Wine | Dry white, 1/2 cup | 

Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.  Then add the white wine and deglaze the pan by using your cooking spoon to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Let the mixture cook down for an additional 3 minutes.

- Egg Noodles | 1 lb, wide | 

Cook egg noodles until they are al dente, according to package instructions, then drain. (For optimal timing, I recommend adding the egg noodles to the boiling water at the same time that you begin Step 4, listed below.)

- Stock | Beef, 1 1/2 cups | 
- Worcestershire Sauce | 1 tbsp | 
- Flour | 3 tbsp | 

While the wine cooks down, whisk together the beef stock, Worcestershire sauce and flour until smooth in a separate bowl. Pour the beef stock mixture into the sauté pan, stir to combine, then let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- Greek Yogurt | 1/2 cup | 

Stir in the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) and cooked steak in until combined. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.

- Fresh Parsley | Optional | Chopped

Serve warm over egg noodles, garnished with a sprinkle of parsley and an extra twist of black pepper, if desired.
