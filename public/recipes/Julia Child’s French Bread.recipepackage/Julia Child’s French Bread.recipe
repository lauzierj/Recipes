## Ingredients

- Yeast | 2 ¼ teaspoons 1 packet instant or active dry | 
- Flour | 3 ½ cups all-purpose | 
- Salt | 2 ¼ teaspoons | 
- 1 ½ Cups Warm Water 120º – 130º |  | 

> Cornmeal for pizza peel optional

## Instructions

In the mixing bowl of a stand mixer using the flat beater, combine the yeast, 2 ½ cups flour and salt. Mix on low for about 30 seconds.

With the motor running on low, pour in the warm water. Continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms. Clean off beater and switch to the dough hook. Mix in the remaining cup of flour a little at a time, to make a soft dough, adding more or less flour as needed. Knead the dough for 5 minutes. The surface should be smooth and the dough will be soft and somewhat sticky.

Turn the dough onto a kneading surface and let rest for 2 – 3 minutes while you wash and dry the bowl and spray it with non-stick spray.

Return the dough to the mixing bowl and let it rise, covered, at room temperature (about 75º) until 3 ½ times its original volume. This will probably take about 3 hours.

Gently deflate the dough and return it to the bowl. Let the dough rise at room temperature until not quite tripled in volume, about 1 ½ – 2 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare the rising surface: rub flour into canvas or linen towel placed on a baking sheet. (You can use parchment paper.)

Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Fold each piece of dough in two, cover loosely, and let the pieces relax for 5 minutes.

Shape the loaves and place them on the prepared towel or parchment. Cover the loaves loosely and let them rise at room temperature until almost triple in volume, about 1 ½ – 2 ½ hours.

Preheat oven to 450º. Set up a "simulated baker’s oven" by placing a baking stone on the center rack, with a metal broiler pan on the rack beneath, at least 4 inches away from the baking stone to prevent the stone from cracking.

Transfer the risen loaves onto a peel sprinkled with cornmeal.

> Slash the loaves.

Spray the loaves with water. Slide the loaves into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot water to the broiler tray.

Bake for about 25 minutes until golden brown. (If you used parchment paper you will want to remove it after about 10-15 minutes to crisp up the bottom crust. Spray the loaves with water three times at 3-minute intervals.

Cool for 2 – 3 hours before cutting.

## Notes

> Here’s a video of Julia making French Bread, including shaping baguettes. Note: *more flour will be required for dusting and shaping the dough, and you may need more or less flour when mixing the dough as described in step 2.
