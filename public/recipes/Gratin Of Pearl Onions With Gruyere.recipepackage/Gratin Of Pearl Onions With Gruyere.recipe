# Gratin Of Pearl Onions With Gruyere

- Onions | 2 lb pearl fresh or frozen | 
- Unsalted Butter | 5 tbs 1/2 stick | 
- Onion | 1 yellow minced | 
- Flour | 2 1/2 tbs all-purpose | 
- Whole Milk | 2 cups | 
- Nutmeg | 1/4 tsp freshly grated | 
- Salt Ground Pepper | and freshly to taste | 
- Cheese | 1 cup shredded gruyere | 
- Bread Crumbs | 3/4 cup fine dried white | 
- Paprika |  | 

> If you are using frozen onions, which I highly recommend, just follow package directions, cook and drain.

Position a rack in the upper third of an oven and preheat to 375°F.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt 4 Tbs. of the butter. Add the minced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until well mixed and bubbling, about 2 minutes.  Add the milk and cook until the sauce boils and thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the cheese. Add the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Add the pearl onions, adjust the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the onions are hot, about 3 minutes.

Transfer the onion mixture to a 2-quart baking dish and sprinkle the bread crumbs and the rest of the cheese evenly over the top. Add a dash of paprika. Cut the remaining 1 Tbs. butter into 6 equal pieces and dot the bread crumbs evenly with the butter. Bake until the crumbs are golden and small bubbles appear along the edges of the dish, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
