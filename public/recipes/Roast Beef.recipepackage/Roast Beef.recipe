# Roast Beef

![](BD3D1899-AB2D-401F-BBD0-EDAB0266E356.jpg)

- Beef | 4 lb organic roast | 
- Salt | 2 tbsp fine sea | 
- Black Pepper | 2 tsp freshly ground | 
- Garlic | 6 cloves | 
- Butter Oil | 2 tbsp grass-fed ghee or avocado | 
- Beef Broth | ½ cup organic | 
- Red Wine | ½ cup dry | 
- Rosemary | 3 sprigs | 
- Onion | 1 large yellow thinly sliced | 

1. Remove roast from refrigerator about 2 hours before starting recipe to allow it to come closer to room temperature. It will still be a little cool after 2 hours, but not cold.

2. In a small bowl combine salt and pepper.

3. Use a sharp, thin knife to make 3 slits on one side of the roast (about 2-3 inches deep), stuff the slits with the garlic cloves (one clove in each) and some salt and pepper. Flip the roast over and make 3 more slits on the other side and stuff with garlic, salt, and pepper. Rub the remaining salt and pepper over the outside of the roast.

4. Preheat oven to 275ºF.

5. Melt butter over medium-high heat in an oven-safe skillet (braising pan or cast iron). Sear all sides of roast in the hot oil to brown (for about 15 minutes total). Remove roast to a plate and deglaze the bottom of the pan with broth and wine.

6. Place roast back in pan and place onion slices and rosemary sprigs around it.

7. Oven roast at 275ºF until you get to 115ºF (let the pot roast cook for about 12-15 minutes per pound, so a little less than 1 hour for a 4 lb roast).

8. Transfer meat to a cutting board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for about 20 minutes. The internal temp will continue to rise as the roast rests. Serving temp should be 130ºF in the center for medium-rare. You can rest for up to one half hour if you need to.

9. Mix a few teaspoons of arrowroot powder or organic cornstarch with the pan juices to make a gravy. Serve roast beef with gravy and onions.
