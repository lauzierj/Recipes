- French Bread | 3 loaves | 

Cut all the bread into 1-inch cubes and lay them out on sheet pans. Cover with a dish towel and let them dry out for 24-48 hours until they're dry and crisp.

- Butter | 1 stick | 
- Onion Onions | 2 medium | Diced
- Celery | 5 stalks | Diced
- Parsley | 1/2 bunch | Chopped
- Broth | Chicken, 6 cups, low sodium | 
- Basil | Dried, 1/2 tsp | 
- Ground Thyme | 1/2 tsp | 
- Rosemary | Fresh, 1 tbsp | Finely minced
- Salt | to taste | 
- Black Pepper | to taste | 

Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the onions and celery and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the broth, parsley, rosemary, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper and stir.

Put all the bread cubes in a large bowl and slowly ladle in the broth mixture, tossing as you go until the dressing has the moisture level you want. Taste and add more seasonings as needed.

Pour the dressing into a large casserole pan and/or the turkey cavity. Bake the casserole for 20 to 30 minutes at 375 degrees until golden and crisp on top. Serve piping hot with a turkey and gravy!
