- Butter | 3 tablespoons | 
- Garlic | 1 tablespoon minced | 

In a large skillet or 4 quart Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until it starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.

- Flour | 2 tablespoons all-purpose | 
- Half and Half | 3 cups milk or cream | 

Stir in flour until evenly combined and cook for 1 minute. Slowly pour in milk. Stir well and bring the sauce to a simmer, about 5 minutes.

- Chicken | 1 teaspoon bouillon powder | 
- Salt | ½ teaspoon | 
- Pepper | ¼ teaspoon ground black | 

Stir in chicken bouillon powder, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and keep stirring until thickened to a desired consistency, about 3-4 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside.

- Potatoes | 5-6 small yukon gold about 1.5 lb. peeled and sliced | 
- Mozzarella Cheese | 2 cups shredded | 

Arrange half of the sliced potatoes in a 9-inch square casserole pan and top with half of the cream sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese.

Arrange the remaining potato slices over the cheese and top with the remaining cream sauce and cheese.

Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake in a 400F preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake uncovered for another 20-25 minutes until golden brown. Let cool for 5-10 minutes and serve warm
