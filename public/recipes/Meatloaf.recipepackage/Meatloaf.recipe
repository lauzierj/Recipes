# Meatloaf

> MEATLOAF:

- Breadcrumbs | 1 cup plain | 
- Ground Beef | 2 pounds we prefer a higher fat content 80/20 | 
- Onion | 1 medium grated | 
- Egg | 1 large | 
- Worcestershire Sauce | 2 tablespoons | 
- Garlic Powder | ½ teaspoon | 
- Salt | 1 teaspoon | 
- Black Pepper | ½ teaspoon | 

> MEATLOAF SAUCE:

- Ketchup | 1/4 cup | 
- Brown Sugar | 1 tablespoon packed | 
- Worcestershire Sauce | 2 teaspoons | 

Step 1 – Preheat – Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Step 2 – Mix it up – In a large bowl combine the ground beef, grated onion, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and salt to the breadcrumb mixture. Mix together until everything is fully combined, but make sure not to overmix.

Step 4 – Shape loaf – Shape the meat mixture into a loaf approximately 2 inches thick. Place on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet or loaf pan.

Step 5 – Bake – Put the meatloaf in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.

Step 6 – Make glaze – While the meatloaf cooks, make the sauce. In a small bowl whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce to make the meatloaf glaze.

Step 8 – Add glaze and cook again – After cooking for 30 minutes remove the meatloaf from the oven and spread the sauce over the meatloaf. Return it to the oven and resume cooking for the remaining 15 minutes.

Step 9 – Check temperature – When the timer goes off, check the meatloaf with an instant read thermometer. The meatloaf is done when the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. If the meatloaf needs more time, put it back in the oven for an additional 5 minutes.

Step 10 – Rest and serve – Once it has cooked completely remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes. Then slice and serve.
