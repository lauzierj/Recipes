Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300°F (165°C).

- Canned Tomatoes | 4 28-ounce cans, whole peeled, san marzano | 

Place tomatoes in a large bowl. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes by squeezing them in your fingers until pieces no larger than 1/2-inch remain.

Transfer 3 cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator until the sauce is done cooking.

- Olive Oil | Extra Virgin, 1/4 cup | 
- Butter | 4 tbsp | 

Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter is melted.

- Garlic | 8 cloves | Minced

Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes.

- Red Pepper Flakes | 1 tsp | 

> Go half on the pepper flakes for kids.

- Dried Oregano | 1 tbsp | 

Add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

- Carrot | Medium, 1 | Cut into large chunks
- Onion | Medium, 1 | Split in half
- Fresh Basil | 1 large stem | 
- Salt | To taste | 
- Black Pepper | To taste | 

Add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil, and stir to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat.

Cover Dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. Cook, stirring once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red, 5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or the browned bits begin to turn too dark).

- Fish Sauce | 1 tbsp | 
- Fresh Parsley | 1/4 cup | Minced
- Fresh Basil | 1/4 cup | Minced

Remove from oven. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots, and basil stems. Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add fish sauce, if using. Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in minced herbs along with additional olive oil as desired.

Serve immediately, or allow to cool at room temperature, transfer to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Sauce can also be frozen in sealed containers for up to 6 months. To reheat, warm very gently in a saucepan with 1/2 cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through.
