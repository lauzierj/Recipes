## Instructions

Preheat the oven: Heat the oven to 425°F.

Mix everything together: On a large sheet pan add the gnocchi, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, red onion, cherry tomatoes, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, basil, salt, thyme, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Use your hands to combine everything together. Make sure everything is well coated in the spices and oil.

Bake: Place the sheet pan in the oven and bake for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through. Five minutes before the gnocchi and vegetables are finished, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Add the spinach and stir to combine. Return to the oven for the remaining five minutes, just until the spinach is wilted.

Serve: Serve with shaved parmesan cheese, and a drizzle of olive oil.
