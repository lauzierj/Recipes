Set a large covered pot of water over high heat to boil.

- Salt |  | 
- Pasta | Spaghetti, 1 lb | 

When it reaches a rolling boil, salt the water and add the spaghetti, giving a few stirs to keep the pasta from clumping together.

- Olive Oil | Extra virgin, 1/3 cup | 
- Breadcrumbs | 1/2 cup | Optional

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the breadcrumbs if using (if you are not including the breadcrumbs, skip to the next step). Toast the crumbs in the oil, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 3 minutes.

- Garlic | 2 to 3 cloves | Minced

Add the minced garlic and continue cooking until it is just fragrant and lightly colored, about 1 minute. Be careful not to overcook the garlic or it will become bitter.

- Crushed Red Pepper | 1/2 tsp | 
- Parsley | Flat-leaf, 1/4 cup | Chopped

Add the red pepper (dried or fresh) and chopped parsley, if using. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

When your pasta is al dente, drain it, reserving a few tablespoons of the cooking water.

Add the spaghetti to the skillet and toss until evenly coated. Add a little bit of the pasta cooking water as needed if the mixture is too dry. Serve and enjoy.
