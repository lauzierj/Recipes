- Cream Cheese | 16 oz block | Softened to room temperature
- Sour Cream | 2 cups | 

Combine softened cream cheese and sour cream in a large bowl and stir together until creamed and well-combined (I like to use my electric mixer just to make sure there are no lumps).

- Taco Seasoning | 1 packet, 4 oz | 

Add taco seasoning and stir well.

Spread mixture evenly into a 9-10" pie dish.

- Lettuce | 1 cup | Finely chopped
- Tomatoes | Roma, 4 | Seeds removed, diced
- Olives | ½ cup | Sliced
- Pickled Jalapeños | Sliced | 
- Mexican Cheese | Shredded, 1 ¼ cup | 

Top mixture with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, olives, jalapenos (if using) and finally evenly sprinkle with shredded cheese.

Taco dip can be served immediately or can be covered and stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

- Chips | Tortilla |
