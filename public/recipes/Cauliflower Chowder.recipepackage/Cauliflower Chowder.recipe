- Bacon | 6 slices | Diced

Heat a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Leave remaining bacon grease in the pot.

- Butter | Unsalted, 2 tbsp | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced
- Onion | 1 | Diced
- Carrots | 2 | Peeled and diced
- Celery | 2 stalks | Diced

Melt butter in the stockpot. Add garlic, onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.

- Cauliflower | 1 head | Roughly chopped

Stir in cauliflower. Cook, stirring occasionally, until barely crisp-tender, about 3-4 minutes.

- Flour | All-purpose, 1/4 cup | 
- Chicken broth | 4 cups | 
- Milk | 2%, 1 cup | 

Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and milk, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes.

- Salt | to taste | Kosher
- Black Pepper | to taste | Freshly Ground

Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until cauliflower are tender, about 12-15 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Mash the cauliflower lightly. If the chowder is too thick, add more milk as needed until desired consistency is reached.
