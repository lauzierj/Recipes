- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1/2 tsp |

In a large saucepan over medium heat, add oil and flour and whisk together to make a paste, cooking for one minute. Pour in the red sauce, chicken broth, cilantro, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 30-45 minutes

- Onion | 1, Medium | Finely diced
- Green Chilies | Diced, 2 x 4 oz | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 

If using ground beef, season with salt and brown the meat with onions in a skillet. Drain off fat.

If using chicken, season with salt and pepper, sear chicken in a pan and finish in the oven, then shred it with two forks.

Stir in 2 cans diced green chilies. Set aside.

- Tortillas | Corn, 10-14 | 
- Canola Oil | 1/2 cup | 

Heat canola oil in a small skillet over medium heat. One by one, using tongs, fry tortillas in oil until soft, not crisp – about 30 seconds per side. Remove to a paper—towel lined plate. Repeat until all tortillas have been fried

- Black Olives | Chopped, 1/2 cup |

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pour ½ cup red sauce in bottom of baking pan. Spread to even out. Dip each tortilla into red sauce, then remove to work surface. Spoon meat, a little grated cheese, a little black olives, and green onions in the center of tortilla. Roll up and place, seam down, in baking pan. Repeat until pan is filled. Pour extra red sauce over enchiladas. Top with remaining cheddar cheese

- Cilantro | 1/2 cup | Chopped

Bake for 20 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle cilantro over enchiladas before serving
