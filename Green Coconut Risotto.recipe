# Green Coconut Risotto

> #side #vegetarian

- Coconut Oil | 3 tbsp | 
- Onion | White, 1 cup | Finely diced
- Rice | Aborio, 1 1/2 cups | 

Melt the coconut oil in a deep saucepan or small pot. Add the onions and sweat them until soft, being careful not to brown them. Tip in the rice and stir until the grains are evenly coated with oil and become translucent.

- Curry Paste | Green, 2-3 tbsp | 

Stir in the curry paste until fragrant.

- Stock | Chicken, 4 cups | Heated and kept warm

Pour in 1 cup of stock and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Continue to add stock, 1 cup at a time, still stirring and keeping the heat low for about 15~18 minutes.

- Coconut Milk | Unpasteurized, 1 can, full fat | 
- Basil | 1 cup | 
- Lime | 1/2 | Juiced

Meanwhile, puree the fatty portion of the coconut milk with the basil and lime juice to a vibrant green milk shake. Chill until needed. Stir the remaining watery portion of the coconut milk into the rice.

Once all the stock has been absorbed, taste your risotto and see if you like the doneness. It should be very creamy, but still retaining a bit of nutty texture in the center of each grain.

Incorporate the coconut basil mixture and take away from the heat, and season. Spoon onto warmed plates and top with a few leaves of fried basil.

> Note: To fry the basil, lower basil leaves into hot oil â€“ be careful, they will sputter. Fry each batch for 5-10 seconds without crowding the pan, until crispy and bright green. Drain on paper towel.

- Salt | Sea, to taste | 

Plate and finish with sea salt.
