> #side #vegetarian

- Spinach | 1 lb | 

If using fresh spinach, rinse the leaves thoroughly and remove the stems. If using frozen spinach, defrost and squeeze out any excess water.

- Butter | 2 tbsp | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | 

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

- Flour | All purpose, 2 tbsp | 

Sprinkle the flour over the garlic and butter mixture and whisk to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is light golden brown.

- Milk | 1 cup | 

Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken.

- Heavy Cream | 1/2 cup | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1/4 tsp | 
- Nutmeg | 1/8 tsp | 

Add the heavy cream, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg to the saucepan and whisk until combined.

Add the chopped spinach to the saucepan and stir to combine with the sauce.

Cook the spinach for 2-3 minutes until it is wilted and heated through.

Taste the creamed spinach and adjust the seasoning as needed.

Serve the creamed spinach hot as a side dish with your favorite entree.
