Set a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Add olive oil to the skillet and sauté the greens in batches, allowing each to wilt before adding the next. Stir frequently.

- Olive Oil | 1 tablespoon | 
- Garlic | 4 cloves | 

Make a space in the center of the pan and add remaining olive oil and garlic. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant, then stir into greens.

- Wine | White, dry, 1/2 cup | 
- Lemon | 1/2 lemon | 
- Red Pepper Flakes | 1/2 teaspoon | 
- Salt | To taste |

With heat still on medium-high, pour in the white wine and let the alcohol cook off. Add lemon juice, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Allow any excess moisture to evaporate before serving.
