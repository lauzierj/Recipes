Set your smoker to 275°F (135°C). Set the cooking time to 8 hours and load smoking pellets into the hopper.

- Pork Shoulder | 7 lbs | 
- Bbq Seasoning | 2 tbsp | 
- Smoking Pellets |  | 

Season the pork shoulder liberally on all sides with the BBQ rub. Place it into the preheated smoker and cook until the internal temperature reaches 165–170°F (73–76°C), about 4–5 hours. After the first hour, add another cup of pellets and reignite if needed per your smoker's instructions.

- Apple Juice | 2 oz | 
- Bbq Sauce | 1 cup | 
- Bbq Seasoning | 1 tbsp | 
- Foil or Foil Pan |  | 

Remove the shoulder and transfer it to foil or a foil pan. Pour apple juice, BBQ sauce, and additional rub around and over the pork. Seal the foil tightly to prevent leaks. Insert a thermometer back through the foil into the pork.

Continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 205–210°F (96–99°C) and the pork is probe-tender.

Remove the pork from the smoker and let rest for at least 1 hour, covered. While resting, strain the braising liquid into a saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until reduced to a thick, glossy sauce.

Shred the pork into bite-sized pieces and toss with the reduced sauce.

Serve and enjoy!
