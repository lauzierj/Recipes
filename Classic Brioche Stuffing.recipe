- Butter | Unsalted, 8 tbsp divided | 
- Onion | Yellow, 2 cups | Diced
- Celery | 1½ cups | Diced
- Carrots | 1 cup | Peeled and diced

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Spread brioche cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour or until golden brown and crispy, stirring halfway through. Remove from the oven and let brioche cool completely. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees.

In a large pot, melt 6 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrots, leek and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add parsley, sage, thyme, salt and pepper and stir to combine.

Add toasted brioche cubes and 1½ cups broth and stir gently to combine.

In a medium bowl, whisk together remaining 1½ cups broth and eggs. Add to pot with brioche and stir gently to combine.

Transfer mixture to a greased 9"x13" baking dish. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle over mixture. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake uncovered for 40 more minutes or until the top is golden brown.
