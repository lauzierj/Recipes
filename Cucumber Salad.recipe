# Cucumber Salad

> This super fresh salad is straight from the Student Prince in Springfield. #vegetarian #side #salad

- Cucumbers | 3 large | 

Peel the cucumbers. You may leave half of the peels on. Waxed cucumbers or those that have been stored for a long time should be peeled. Smaller cucumbers and those recently picked can be used without peeling. A peeled cucumber is easier to digest.

- Sugar | 4 oz | 
- Cider Vinegar | 3 oz | 
- Salt | 1 tablespoon | 
- White Pepper | Pinch | 
- Vegetable Oil | 1 oz | 
- Onion | 1, medium | Sliced
- Fresh Dill | 2 tbsp | Chopped

Mix the ingredients for the dressing and pour over the cucumbers, stir the salad a bit. There should be enough dressing to cover the cucumbers. You can add a bit more salt and pepper after you have marinated the cucumbers. The salad will stay good for about three days under refrigeration
