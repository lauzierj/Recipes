- Egg | 1 large | 
- Worcestershire Sauce | 1 tsp | 
- Old Bay Seasoning | 1 tsp | 
- Lemon | 1 tbsp | Juiced
- Parsley | 2 tbsp | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1/4 tsp | 

In a large bowl, mix together mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, beaten egg, Worcestershire sauce, Old Bay seasoning, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and pepper. Gently fold in the crab meat, being careful not to break up the lumps.

- Breadcrumbs | Panko, 1/2 cup, plus more as needed | 
- Butter | 2 tbsp |

Fold breadcrumbs into the crab mixture. Form into patties. If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs as needed.

Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook crab cakes until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes per side. Serve hot with your choice of sauce or lemon wedges.
