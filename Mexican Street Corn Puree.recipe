- Corn | 6 ears | Shucked

Grill the corn on high heat until some kernels begin to brown.

Let the corn cool and cut the kernels off of the cobs. Set aside 1/2 cup of the kernels for garnish and put the rest into a blender or food processor.

- Chili Powder | 1 tsp | 
- Cayenne Pepper | pinch | 
- Salt | to taste | 
- Black Pepper | to taste | 
- Sour Cream | 1/4 cup | 
- Mayo | 1/4 cup | 
- Cotija Cheese | 1/2 cup | Crumbled 

To the food processor with the corn add the sour cream, mayo, most of the cotija cheese (set some aside for garnish), the chili powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, kosher salt, and pepper.

Pulse the food processor until blended. Taste for seasoning and add more chili powder, cayenne, kosher salt, and/or pepper if needed.

- Cilantro | 1/4 cup | Chopped
- Lime | 1 | Cut into wedges

Garnish with the corn kernels and cotija cheese that were set aside earlier, also top with chopped cilantro and serve with a lime wedge and an extra sprinkle of chili powder.
