- Flour | 2 1/2 cups 12.5 ounces; 350g all-purpose divided | 
- Kosher Salt | 1 teaspoon 5g  for table  use same weight or half as much by volume | 

Combine two thirds of flour with sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse twice to incorporate.

- Unsalted Butter | 2 1/2 sticks 10 ounces; 280g cut into 1/4-inch pats see note | 

Spread butter pats evenly over surface. Pulse until no dry flour remains and dough just begins to collect in clumps, about 25 short pulses. Use a rubber spatula to spread the dough evenly around the bowl of the food processor. Sprinkle with remaining flour and pulse until dough is just barely broken up, about 5 short pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.

- Water | 6 tablespoons 3 ounces; 85ml cold | 

Sprinkle with water. Then, using a rubber spatula, fold and press dough until it comes together into a ball.

Divide ball in half. Form each half into a 4-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling and baking.

When ready to shape the dough, pull out one ball, set it on a well-floured work surface, and sprinkle with more flour. Use a tapered rolling pin to start rolling the dough out into a circle, lifting the dough and rotating it while rolling to achieve an even shape. Continue rolling, changing the angle of your rolling pin as you go to get an even shape and thickness. The finished dough should overhang your pie plate by an inch or two.

Pick up the dough by carefully rolling it around your rolling pin, using your bench scraper to help lift it off the work surface. Unroll it over a pie plate. Gently lift and fit the dough into the pie plate, getting down into the corners.
