- Cilantro | 2 small bunches | Stems removed

Remove all the hard stems/stalks from the cilantro, the tender ones are okay to have and then wash the cilantro.

- Chili | Green, 1 | 
- Ginger | 1/2 inch | 
- Cumin | 1/4 tsp | 
- Chaat Masala | 1/8 tsp | Optional
- Black Pepper | Pinch | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp or to taste | 
- Lemon | 2 tsp | Juiced
- Sugar | 1/2 tsp | 

To a blender add the cilantro leaves, green chili, ginger, cumin powder, chaat masala, black pepper and salt. Also add in lemon juice and sugar.

- Yogurt | Plain, 1/4 cup | 

Add yogurt to the blender. I have used vegan yogurt here in this recipe (plain almond milk yogurt).

Blend it all together to a smooth consistency. If your chutney has a runny consistency, you may add a teaspoon of sev or peanuts to the chutney to make it thicker.

> Add 1 teaspoon at a time and then go from there.

Keep this cilantro chutney refrigerated and use it as needed. You can also freeze the chutney.
