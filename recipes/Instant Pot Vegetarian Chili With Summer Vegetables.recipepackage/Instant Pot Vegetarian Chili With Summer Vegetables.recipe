- Olive Oil | 2 tsp | 
- Onion | Yellow, 1, small | Diced
- Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced
- Zucchini | 1 medium | Diced
- Yellow Squash | 1 medium | Diced
- Pepper | Red bell, 1 | Diced
- Tomato | 3, medium | Diced
- Corn | Frozen, 1 cup | 

Press the ‘sauté’ button on your instant pot.  Add the olive oil and the onion.  Cook for 1 minutes and then add the garlic.  Cook for another 30 seconds and add the tomatoes, red pepper, zucchini, squash and corn.

- Beans | Pinto, 1 can | 
- Beans | Kidney, 1 can | 
- Beans | Black, 1 can | 
- Broth | Vegetable, 2 1/2 cups | 
- Chili Powder | 2 1/2 tsp | 
- Cumin | 2 1/2 tsp | 
- Paprika | 1 1/2 tsp | 
- Italian Seasoning | 1 tsp | 
- Coconut Sugar | 1 tsp | 
- Salt | 1 tsp or more to taste | 
- Black Pepper | 1/2 tsp | 
- Tomato Paste | 6 oz | 

Cook vegetables until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes.  Add the beans, broth and all the spices.  Stir until combined and add the tomato paste right on top of everything.  You don’t need to stir it in.  If you do, there is a chance it will be too thick and burn.

Turn the sauté mode off.  Securely fasten the lid on the instant pot and set the pressure valve to closed.  Press the ‘pressure cook’ button and set it for 8 minutes.

Once it’s finished cooking, carefully turn the pressure valve to open and wait for all the steam to be released.  Open your instant pot and give the chili a good stir before serving.  Add your favorite toppings and enjoy!
