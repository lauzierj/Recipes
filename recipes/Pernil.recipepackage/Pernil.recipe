> A Puerto Rican meal to gather the family around like its Thanksgiving. #latin #pork #comfort

- Adobo | a lot | 
- Garlic | 1 bulb | 
- Olive Oil | Light | 
- Sazón | 1 packet | 
- Black Pepper | a lot | 
- Oregano | 2 tsp | 

Using a stone mortar and pestle, grind the garlic to break it apart. Add sazón, black pepper, adobo, oregano, and olive oil.

Mix until it forms a paste, adjusting the finished product with more oil or adobo to get the desired consistency.

- Pork | Shoulder, 7-9 lbs, bone in | 

Score the skin in both directions making 1 1/2 inch squares.

Carefully separate the skin from the shoulder leaving the side wrapped around the bone attached.

Using a deboning knife, make deep, 1 inch incisions. Stretch them by inserting your finger. Do this all around the roast including under the flap.

Using your fingers, stuff the incisions with the paste. Rub it all over - including under the flap, over the skin, and along the underside.

Wrap the roast tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator over night.

Remove the roast from the fridge for 1 hour prior to cooking so it can come to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

> Target an internal temperature of 205 degrees and adjust the temp based on the trajectory of hitting it at your desired mealtime.

Roast for 60-90 minutes per pound covered for the first half, uncovered for the second.

Crank the heat to 450 for the final 30 minutes to crisp the skin.
