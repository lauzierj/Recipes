- Ricotta | Whole milk, 15 oz | 
- Basil | 1/2 cup | Roughly chopped
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Lemon |  | Juiced and zested

Add the ricotta, basil, salt, lemon juice and lemon zest to a food processor. Blend until smooth and creamy to your liking. About one minute should do it, though you could go up to two minutes for an even airier dip. Check periodically to see when it transforms into your desired consistency.

- Olive Oil | Extra virgin | Drizzled for serving, optional
- Basil | For garnish, optional | 

Spoon into a bowl for serving. If desired, garnish it a drizzle of olive oil and additional herbs. Serve with grilled bread or your favorite dipper. Enjoy!
