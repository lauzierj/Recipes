- Flour | All Purpose. 3 cups | 
- Baking Powder | 2 tsp | 
- Salt | 1 1/2 tsp | 

Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.

- Olive Oil | 3 tbsp | 
- Water | Cold, 1 cup | 
- Olive Oil | 2 to 3 tbsp | 

Add the oil and ice water, and mix to make a soft, cohesive dough. Adjust with flour or water as needed. The dough should be moist but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes.

Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet on the stovetop. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer in the pan.

Divide the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces. Each piece should weigh about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces, about the size of a large egg. Dredge each piece in flour, and roll to a rough circle or oval, about 1/4" thick. OR hand shape the pieces by flattening between your palms.
