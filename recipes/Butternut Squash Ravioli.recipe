# Butternut Squash Ravioli

> This dish is served with a maple cream sauce and garnished with bacon. #pasta

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

- Butter | 4 tbsp | 

Just before the pasta water is at a boil, melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.

- Shallot | 1 large diced | 

Add the shallot, and cook until translucent, approximately 2 minutes.

- Pasta | Ravioli, Butternut Squash | 
- Light Cream | 2 cups | 
- Maple Syrup | 2 tbsp | 
- Thyme | 1 tsp | 
- Salt |  | 
- Black Pepper |  | 

After dropping the pasta, add the cream, and allow to simmer for one minute to meld flavors. Add the maple syrup, stirring to combine, then add thyme, salt and pepper to taste, and cook sauce over medium heat, stirring occasionally until ravioli are done.

> Even fresh, the ravioli will take approximately 7-10 minutes to cook through.

> The ravioli should be entirely pasta-colored when fully cooked. If they have butternut squash color coming through in the filling area, they aren't quite done.

Add the cooked ravioli to the saute pan and allow to simmer in the sauce for a minute or two, spooning sauce over top to coat.
