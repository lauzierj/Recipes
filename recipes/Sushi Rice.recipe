> #japanese #vegetarian

- Rice | Sushi, 2 cups | Rinsed very well and drained

Rinse the rice thoroughly.

- Water | 2 cups | 
- Kambu | 1 sheet, optional | 

Combine the rice and water in a pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Optionally, include a sheet of Kambu.

Once the boil is reached, reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.

- Vinegar | Rice, 1/4 cup | 
- Sugar | 4 tsp | 
- Salt | 1 tsp | 

While the rice cooks, combine the seasoning ingredients, heat in the microwave for 30 seconds, and stir.

When the rice is done cooking and while it is still hot, fold in the seasoning.

Cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel and let it cook on the counter.

Use immediate or store in the refrigerator. To revive cold rice, microwave in 30 second intervals covered with a damp paper towel until it reaches the desired doneness.
