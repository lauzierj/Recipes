- Haddock | 1 lb | 

Rinse and pat your haddock dry using paper towels.

- Olive Oil | 1 tsp | 

On a countertop lay out a section of tinfoil for each fillet you will be having. Lightly coat with brushed olive oil or use non stick cooking spray on the inside of each foil sheet.

- Lemon | 1, large | Sliced

Arrange 2-3 lemon slices (depending on the size of your fillets) in a line down the center of each packet.

- Salt | 1 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1 tsp | 
- Dill | Fresh, 1 tsp | Chopped

Season each fillet (salt, pepper, dill weed) then set the haddock fillets on the lemon slices. Wrap each fillet in the foil being sure it is completely sealed with the seam facing upward.

Place foil packs on grill over a medium heat. Cook for approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your haddock. Remove from heat and check your fillets for the fish to be done.

- Olive Oil | 1 tsp | 
- Onion | White, ⅛, medium | finely minced

Bring a small saucepan with the olive oil to medium high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the minced onion and saute for 2-3 minutes or until tender.

- Heavy Cream | ¼ cup | 
- Butter | 1 tbsp | 
- Lemon | 1/4, large | Zested and juiced

Reduce heat to low, and add in the heavy cream. Once the cream is warmed, add the butter and cook until it is melted. Add the lemon zest and juice, then continue cooking for another 2 minutes.

- Parmesan Cheese | 1 tablespoon | Grated

Add in the grated Parmesan cheese and stir until it is fully melted. Spoon the lemon cream sauce over your grilled haddock and enjoy!
