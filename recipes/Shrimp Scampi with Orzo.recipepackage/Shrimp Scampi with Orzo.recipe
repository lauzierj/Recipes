- Shrimp | 1 lb, large | Peeled, deveined
- Olive Oil | Extra Virgin, 1 tbsp | 
- Lemon | 1 tbsp | Zested
- Crushed Red Pepper | 1/2 tsp | 
- Salt | To taste | 
- Black Pepper | To taste | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced

In a medium bowl, stir together shrimp, 1 tablespoon olive oil, lemon zest, red-pepper flakes, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper and half the garlic. Set aside to marinate. (This step can be done up to 1 hour in advance.)

- Olive Oil | Extra Virgin, 2 tbsp | 
- Butter | Unsalted, 2 tbsp | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced
- Orzo | 1 cup | 
- Wine | Dry white, 1/3 cup | 
- Stock | Chicken, 2 cups | Boiling

Add butter, remaining olive oil and remaining garlic to a medium skillet set over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add the orzo and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until the orzo is toasted, about 2 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent the garlic from burning. Carefully add the wine — it will bubble — and stir until absorbed, about 1 minute. Stir in stock, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until orzo is al dente, about 12 minutes.

Add the shrimp in a snug, even layer on top of the orzo, cover, and cook until all the shrimp is pink and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, 2 minutes.

- Parsley | 2 tbsp | Finely chopped
- Lemon | 1 tbsp | Juiced

Sprinkle with parsley and lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
