Start by preheating your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).

- Zucchini | 2 medium-sized | cut into 1/2 inch wide fries
- All-purpose flour | 1/2 cup | 
- Eggs | 2 | beaten
- Panko breadcrumbs | 1 cup | 
- Grated parmesan cheese | 1/4 cup | 
- Garlic powder | 1 tsp | 
- Onion powder | 1 tsp | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Pepper | 1/4 tsp | 

In three separate shallow dishes, prepare the breading stations. In the first dish, place the all-purpose flour. In the second dish, pour the beaten eggs. In the third dish, combine the Panko breadcrumbs, grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.

Dip each zucchini fry into the flour, making sure to shake off any excess. Then, dip the floured zucchini into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the zucchini fry with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the zucchini to adhere well.

Place the breaded zucchini fries in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Ensure they are not touching to allow proper airflow. You may need to cook in batches.

- Cooking spray |  | for light coating

Lightly spray the zucchini fries with cooking spray. This helps them to brown and crisp up.

Cook the zucchini fries in the air fryer for 10-12 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.

Remove from the air fryer and serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.
