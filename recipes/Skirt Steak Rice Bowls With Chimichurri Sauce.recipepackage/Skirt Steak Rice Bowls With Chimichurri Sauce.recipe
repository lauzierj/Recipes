- Kosher Salt | 1½ tsp | 
- Black Pepper | ¼ tsp freshly ground |

- For Serving |  | 
- Cilantro | 1 cup chimichurri | 
- Rice | 2-3 cups cooked white |

## Instructions

Season the steak. Pat the steak dry with a paper towel, then season generously with 1½ tsp Kosher salt and ¼ tsp (or more, depending on personal preference) of black pepper on all sides. Allow the steak to sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before cooking.

> Make the chimichurri sauce. If you haven't already, make our Cilantro Chimichurri sauce.

Cook the steak. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat for about 5 minutes, until very hot. Add 2 Tbsp neutral oil, then carefully add the seasoned steak to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until an internal temperature of 125-130F is reached. The temperature will continue to rise as it rests. For medium-rare, we want the final temperature 130-135F.

Allow the steak to rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing thinly across the grain.

Assemble rice bowls. Divide rice evenly between bowls, then top each with sliced skirt steak. Spoon as much of the chimichurri sauce on top as you like, then sprinkle the steak with a pinch of flaky sea salt. Optional for serving: pickled red onions, additional cilantro, and lime wedges.
