- Chicken | Breast, boneless skinless, 1 1/2 lb | Cut into 1” cubes
- Soy Sauce | Low sodium, 1/4 cup | 
- Peanut Butter | 2 tbsp | 
- Rice Vinegar | 1 tbsp | 
- Lime | Juiced, 1 tbsp | 
- Sesame Oil | 2 tsp | 
- Honey | 2 tsp | 
- Ginger | Grated, 1 tsp | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced
- Crushed Red Pepper | 1/4 tsp | 
- Salt | to taste | 
- Black Pepper | To taste | 
- Peanut Dipping Sauce |  | 
- Green Onions |  | Cut on the bias 
- Cilantro |  | Chopped

Place chicken in a large bowl or ziplock bag.

To make the marinade, whisk together the soy sauce, peanut butter, rice vinegar, lime juice, sesame oil, honey, ginger, garlic, crushed red pepper and salt/pepper until combined. Reserve a couple tablespoons of the mixture and pour the rest over top of chicken until completely coated. Seal the bag or cover and marinate chicken in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.

While the chicken is marinating, this is a good time to whip up the delicious peanut dipping sauce! (click link for recipe)  Simply whisk together all the ingredients for the peanut sauce in a medium bowl and set aside until ready to serve.

If using wooden skewers, make sure to let them soak in warm water for 30 minutes to an hour to prevent them from charring too much on the grill.  Thread the chicken onto the skewers (about 5 pieces per skewer) and preheat the grill or grill pan on medium-high heat, making sure to spray the grill grates with non-stick spray to prevent the chicken from sticking.

Place the chicken skewers on the grill and cook them about 5 to 6 minutes on each side, brushing with the reserved marinade until the chicken is cooked through.  The internal temp should read 165 degrees F with a meat thermometer.

Top with chopped cilantro and green onions, if desired, and drizzle on some of the peanut sauce.  Enjoy!
