Preheat oven to 350F

- Banana | 1 | Ripened
- Butter | 1/4 cup | Softened

Add the softened butter and banana to the bowl and mix until blended and smooth.

- Egg | 1 | 
- Milk | ~3/4 cups | Milk and egg should total 1 cup

Add the egg to a liquid measuring cup and then add milk to make one cup.

- Vanilla | 1 1/2 tsp | 
- Flour | 1 1/2 cups | 
- Sugar | 1 cup | 
- Baking Soda | 1 tsp | 
- Salt | 1 pinch | 

Add the egg and milk, vanilla, flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt, and mix until no lumps remain.

Prepare a loaf pan by greasing it with butter and dusting with flour evenly.

Pour the batter into loaf pan, and bake for about 40-45 minutes, until risen and golden brown on top, and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out without batter clinging to it. (Moist crumbs are fine.)

Cool for a few minutes before cutting.
