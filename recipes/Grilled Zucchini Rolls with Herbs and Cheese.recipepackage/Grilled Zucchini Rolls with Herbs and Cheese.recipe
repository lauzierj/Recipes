- Zucchini | 3 | Thinly sliced, lengthwise, 1/4 inch
- Olive Oil | 1 tbsp | 
- Salt | 1/8 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | pinch | 

Discard the outermost slices of zucchini and brush the rest of the slices with the oil on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. Place on a preheated grill or grill pan for about 4 minutes on each side, or until tender.

- Goat Cheese | 1 1/2 oz | 
- Parsley | 1 tbsp | Minced
- Lemon | 1/2 tsp | Juiced

In a small bowl combine the goat cheese, parsley leaves and lemon juice, mashing with a fork.

- Baby Spinach | 2 cups | 
- Basil | 1/3 cup | 

Put 1/2 teaspoon of the cheese mixture about 1/2-inch from the end of a zucchini slice. Top with a few spinach leaves and 1 small, or half of a large basil leaf. Roll up and place seam side down on a platter. Repeat with the rest of the zucchini slices.
