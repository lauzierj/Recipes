Preheat oven to 425Â°F and line a baking sheet pan with parchment paper (for easy clean-up).

Pour onto prepared baking sheet. Arrange carrots in a single layer.

Bake 18-20 minutes for baby or garden carrots, 25-30 minutes for larger store bought carrots. Ensure carrots are tender when pierced with a fork.
