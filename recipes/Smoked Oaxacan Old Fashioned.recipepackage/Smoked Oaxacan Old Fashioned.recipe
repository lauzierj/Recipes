- Mezcal | 1/2 oz | 
- Agave Nectar | 1 tsp | 
- Angostura Bitters | 2-4 dashes | 

Combine reposado tequila, mezcal, bitters, and agave nectar in the glass. Use a bar spoon to m ix everything together.

Place the glass with the cocktail under the smoking cloche and insert the tip of the smoking gun into the designated valve on the cloche.

Prepare and start the smoking gun as instructed in your manual and fill the cloche with smoke.

Turn off the gun and let the cocktail sit under the smoke-filled cloche for 5 minutes.

Lift the cloche, stir the cocktail, and add an oversized ice cube.

Cover back up with the cloche and fill it with smoke once again. Let the cocktail sit there another 5 minutes.

You can enjoy the cocktail now or fill it with smoke one more time if you wish for a smokier flavor.
