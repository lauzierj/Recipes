## Ingredients

- Mushrooms | 2 cups portobello cubed smaller pieces gills removed *see note about sauteing first | 
- Black Beans | 2 cups cooked rinsed and divided | 
- Broccoli | 1 cup minced fresh only | 
- Onion | 1/2 cup red minced | 
- Eggs | 3 xl beaten | 
- Panko | 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoon or gluten free | 
- Montreal Steak Seasoning | 1 tablespoon | 
- Worcestershire | 1 tablespoon for full vegetarian or vegan style use one that does not contain anchovies like this one | 
- Garlic | 2 tablespoon minced | 
- Parmesan Cheese | 3/4 cup fresh grated look for vegetarian or vegan if you do not eat animal products | 
- Olive Oil |  | 
- Cook Mode Prevent Your Screen From Going Dark |  | 

In a large bowl add 1 cup of black beans and mash with a masher (chunks are OK).

Next, add in the mushrooms (preferred sauteed), the rest of the beans, broccoli, garlic, onion, Worcestershire and steak seasoning.

Mix just until coated.

Add in the eggs, cheese and bread crumbs and mix gently with a large spoon until the mixture is combined.

Set aside while you place a medium non-stick pan over medium heat and add in 2 tablespoon of oil.

Once the oil starts to shimmer (about a minute or two), using dampened hands (the mixture will stick to you if you don’t), scoop a 1/2 cup of mixture into the palm of your hand and gently shape into a burger all the while pressing together. The mixture should hold a burger shape. If it doesn’t add just a tablespoon more of bread crumbs.

Place in the oil and cook for 3-5 minutes per side or until golden brown and a crust has formed on each side.

Serve with hummus, guacamole or steak sauce.
