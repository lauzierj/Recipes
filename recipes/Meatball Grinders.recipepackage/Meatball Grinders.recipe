- Pasta Sauce | Tomato Basil, 1/2 cup | 
- Pizza Sauce | 1/2 cup | 

Combine sauces in a small pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

- Homemade Meatballs | 6-8 | Each cut into 8 pieces

> If meatballs are cold, they can be warmed in the sauce.

Preheat panini press to medium. Spray with cooking spray.

- Club Rolls | 4 | Cut in half
- Shredded Mozzarella |  | 

Arrange the meatball pieces in a single layer on the bottom half of each roll. Spoon sauce over meatballs, spread a 1/4 cup of cheese, and cover with top half of the rolls.

Place sandwiches on the press and close, applying even pressure to smash them down a bit. Cook until golden brown.
