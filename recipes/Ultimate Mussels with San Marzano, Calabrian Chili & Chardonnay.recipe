• Mussels | 2 lb | Scrubbed, debearded, soaked in cold salted water 20 min to purge grit. Discard any cracked or unresponsive.

Prepare mussels as described and set aside.

• Olive Oil | 2 tbsp |

• Unsalted Butter | 2 tbsp |

• Shallots | 2 | Finely chopped

• Garlic | 4 cloves | Minced

In a large wide pot over medium heat, warm olive oil and butter. Add shallots and sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

• Calabrian Chili Paste (or chopped Calabrian chilies) | 1 tbsp |

## • Red Chili Flakes | Pinch | (Optional)

• Tomato Paste | 2 tbsp |

Stir in Calabrian chili paste and optional chili flakes. Let bloom in the oil for about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and cook until slightly darkened to deepen flavor.

• San Marzano Tomatoes (canned) | 1 cup | Hand-crushed or diced, with juice

• Chardonnay (dry, crisp) | 1½ cups |

Add San Marzano tomatoes and stir. Pour in Chardonnay. Bring to a lively simmer and let reduce for about 4 minutes to concentrate flavors.

• Prepared Mussels | 2 lb |

Add mussels to the pot and toss to coat in sauce. Cover and steam until mussels open, 5–7 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally for even cooking. Discard any mussels that remain closed.

• Fresh Parsley | 2 tbsp | Chopped

• Fresh Basil | 1 tbsp | Torn or chiffonade

• Sea Salt & Black Pepper | To taste |

Stir in parsley and basil. Season with salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste.

• Lemon | 1 | Cut into wedges

## • Crusty Bread | To serve |

Ladle mussels and plenty of broth into bowls. Squeeze lemon over just before serving. Serve hot with crusty bread for dunking.
