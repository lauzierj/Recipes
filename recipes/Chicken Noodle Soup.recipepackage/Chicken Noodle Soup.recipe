- Chicken | 3.5 lb whole | rinsed and cleaned
- Garlic | 1 head | cut in half horizontally
- Carrots | 2 | cut into chunks
- Celery | 2 ribs | cut into chunks
- Onions | 2 | peeled and cut into quarters
- Black Peppercorns | 1 tbsp | 
- Bay Leaves | 2, fresh or dried | 
- Thyme | 4 sprigs | 
- Water | 9 – 10 cups water, enough to just cover | 

Place the chicken in a large pot. Add remaining Broth ingredients, then add enough water so the chicken is just covered (too much water = weak broth).

Cover with lid, bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Then adjust heat so it’s simmering GENTLY with the lid on. Simmer 1.5 hours until chicken is tender and easily comes off the bone. (Or 8 hours on low in a slow cooker)

Scoop scum off surface once or twice during first 30 minutes.

Transfer chicken to pan. Shred meat and discard bones. You'll only need half the chicken meat, save the rest for another purpose.

Remove carrots, celery etc from broth, and discard. Optional: Chop carrot and celery, add back into soup with chicken. (Note 5)

- Olive Oil | 1 tbsp | 
- Onion | 1 large | diced
- Garlic | 3 cloves | minced
- Carrots | 2 medium | cut in quarters lengthwise then chopped
- Celery | 2 ribs | cut into 1 cm/ 1/2″ thick pieces

Heat oil in a large pot over medium meat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 2 minutes. Add celery and carrots, cook for 5 minutes until softened and a bit sweet, don’t let them brown.

- Chicken Broth | 2 quarts | homemade above

Turn heat up to medium high. Gently pour 8 cups broth in (top up with water if necessary), leaving behind residue settled in the bottom of the broth pot.

- Better Than Bouillon | Chicken, 2 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1/2 tsp | 
- Bay Leaf | 1 | 
- Thyme | 4 sprigs | 

Add Vegeta (stock powder), thyme, bay leaf and pepper. Stir.

- Pasta | Mini Farfalle, 6 oz | 

When it starts bubbling, add noodles/pasta. Cook for time per packet MINUS 2 minutes. Stir gently only once or twice (Note 6).

- Chicken | 2 cups | shredded from homemade broth

Add half the chicken, stir (it warms quickly), then season with salt and pepper to taste – season well!

- Parsley |  | finely chopped

Serve soup immediately, garnished with fresh parsley.
