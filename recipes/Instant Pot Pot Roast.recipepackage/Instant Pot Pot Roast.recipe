- Beef | Rump Roast, 4 – 6 lbs | Trimmed of excess fat and cut into 2 lb chunks 
- Kosher Salt | 2 tbsp | 
- Dried Basil | 1 tbsp | 
- Dried Rosemary | 1 tbsp | 
- Onion Powder | 1 tbsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1 tbsp | 
- Oregano | 1 tbsp | 
- Garlic Powder | 1 tbsp | 

Place roast on a large piece of foil for easy clean up.  Combine salt, basil, rosemary, onion powder, black pepper, oregano, and garlic powder in a small bowl.  Press the seasonings into all sides of the roast.

- Olive Oil | 2 tbsp | 

Select saute or brown on the pressure cooker.  When it says “HOT” add oil.

Add meat and brown each side for about 4 minutes.  This process will take 15 – 20 minutes.  May need to be done in batches if you're cooking more than 4 pounds of meat.

Remove beef from the pot and set on a plate.

- Beef Broth | 15 oz | 

Pour beef broth into the pot and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom.  Return beef to the pot.

Turn the pressure cooker off.

Secure the lid and turn pressure release knob to a sealed position.  Cook at high pressure for 90 minutes.

> When cooking is complete, use a natural release.

Set beef on a cutting board to rest.  Pour drippings from the pot into a fat separator then pour it back into the pot, discarding the fat.  If you don’t have a fat separator, you can skim the top of the liquid with a spoon to remove some of the fat, or just skip this step.

- Cornstarch | 3 tbsp | 
- Water | 3 tbsp, cold | 

Combine cornstarch and water in a small cup.  Using the saute function, bring the drippings to a simmer and whisk vigorously as you pour in the cornstarch slurry.

- Worcestershire Sauce | 1 - 2 tbsp | 

Continue stirring for 1-2 minutes as it thickens.  Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.  If the gravy is too salty, you can adjust by mixing up more cornstarch slurry to dilute it.

Slice, shred, or chunk the roast and serve with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy.
