- Fish | Cod, 12 oz | 
- Salt |  | 
- Black Pepper |  | Freshly Ground
- Cayenne Pepper | 3 dashes | 
- Corn Starch | 2 tbsp | 

Cut the fish into pieces, not to thin for easy pan-frying. Season the fish with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Coat the fish with corn starch. Set aside.

- Butter | Salted, 4 tbsp | Melted
- Garlic | 3 cloves | Minced
- Lemon | Juice, 1/2 tbsp | 
- Parsley | 1 tbsp | Chopped

Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Set aside.

- Vegetable Oil | 2 tbsp | 

Heat up a skillet (preferably non-stick) on medium heat. Add the cooking oil and once the oil is heated, pan-fry the fish in a single layer until both sides turn crispy and golden brown. Use a wooden spatula or tong to gently flip the fish over. Try not to break the fish.

- Lemon | 1 | Cut into wedges

Remove the fish from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Toss the fish with the Garlic Butter Sauce and serve immediately with lemon wedges.
