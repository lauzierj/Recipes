- Mayonnaise | 3 tbsp | 
- Ketchup | 1 tbsp | 
- Relish | Sweet Pickle, 2 tsp | 
- Sugar | 1/2 tsp | 
- Vinegar | Distilled white, 1/2 tsp | 

For the Sauce, combine all ingredients in a small bowl, and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use (sauce can be refrigerated up to 5 days).

Preheat oven or toaster oven to 400Â°F.

- Vegetable Oil | 1 tsp | 
- Onion | 1 large, 1 1/2 cups | Finely chopped
- Salt |  | 

In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon (5ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until onions are well browned, about 15 minutes.

Once onions begin to sizzle heavily and appear dry, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water to skillet and stir to scrape up any browned bits. Continue cooking until water evaporates and onions start sizzling again, about 1 minute.

Repeat process, adding 1 tablespoon (15ml) of water at a time, until onions are meltingly soft and dark brown, about 3 times total. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.

- Hamburger Buns | 4, Arnold brand | 

Place closed buns in preheated oven until slightly darkened and crisped, about 2 minutes.

In a 12-inch skillet, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Open buns and add face-down to skillet. Toast until dark brown around the edges, about 1 minute total. Transfer buns to a plate or tray; wipe out skillet.

- Pickles Chips | Dill, 8 | 
- Tomatoes | 1 | Sliced
- Lettuce | Iceberg, 2 leaves | 

Spread sauce on bottom halves of each bun, then top each with 4 pickle slices, 1 slice tomato, and 1 lettuce leaf. Set aside.

- Ground Beef | Chuck, 8 ounces, 60/40 | 
- Black Pepper |  | 
- Salt |  | 

Form ground beef into four 2-ounce balls. Using damp hands, press each into a patty that is 3/16-inch-thick, and 4 inches in diameter. Season generously with salt and pepper.

In now-empty skillet, heat remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add beef patties and cook without moving until well browned and crusty on bottom side, about 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

- Mustard | Yellow, 1/4 cup | 

Using a spoon, spread 1 tablespoon (15ml) mustard on raw side of each patty. Using a spatula, flip patties so mustard side is down, and continue to cook for 1 minute.

- American Cheese | 4 slices | 

Top each patty with 1 slice of cheese. Divide onion mixture evenly between the patties.

Transfer burgers to prepared bottom buns. Close sandwiches, and serve immediately.
