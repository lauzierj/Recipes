## Ingredients

- Yeast | 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry 2 packets | 
- Warm Water | 1/2 cup | 
- Sugar | 1/2 teaspoon granulated | 
- 2 Cups Hot Water Hot To The Touch, Not Boiling |  | 
- Sugar | 3 tablespoons granulated | 
- Salt | 1 tablespoon | 
- Vegetable Oil | 1/2 cup | 

> 5-6 cups all-purpose flour add more if needed to get to a pliable dough

- Egg | 1 large white for brushing on loaves | 

## Instructions

Dissolve yeast, 1/2 cup warm water, and 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar in a small bowl.

In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine 2 cups hot water, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, the salt, and the oil. Add 3 cups of flour to the mixture in this large bowl/mixer and mix well. Stir in yeast mixture.

Add 2 – 3 cups more flour and mix until well blended. (At this point your dough will still be quite sticky). Leave in bowl, cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour. (If using a mixer, remove the bowl from the mixer and cover. Otherwise your paddle attachment or dough hook will get covered in dough when it rises). NO KNEADING IS REQUIRED.

> After the rise, if the dough is too sticky to handle, add more flour until its workable. For some people this can be up to a cup or more! Just don't dry out the dough. Add by quarter cupfuls until its workable.

> Divide dough into 2 (or 3 if you want smaller loaves) pieces. Roll out each piece on a floured surface into the length desired then roll up lengthwise like a jelly roll. If it's still too sticky, add more flour until it's workable but not dry.

Put on a greased cookie sheet, sealed side down, and tuck the ends under. Slash the top diagonally across the top every couple of inches with a sharp knife.

Cover and let loaves rise 30 more minutes.

While loaves are rising, preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

> Whisk the egg white and brush over the top of loaves.

Bake for 25 – 30 minutes.
