## Method

In a small bowl, combine the garlic, ¼ cup of water, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, chili sauce, and cornstarch. Whisk until smooth.

In a large skillet, add the oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the bell pepper, asparagus, and snow peas. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 3-4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink and opaque, 3-4 minutes more.

Pour the sauce into the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the shrimp, about 5 minutes

Serve over cooked rice, sprinkled with cilantro and sesame seeds, if using.
