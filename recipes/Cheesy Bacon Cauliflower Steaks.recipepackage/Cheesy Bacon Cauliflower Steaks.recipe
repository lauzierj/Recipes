- Cauliflower | 1 head | 
- Olive Oil | Extra virgin, 2 tbsp | 
- Garlic Powder | 1/4 tsp | 
- Paprika | 1/4 tsp | 
- Salt |  | 
- Black Pepper |  | Freshly ground
- Mexican Cheese | 1/2 cups | 
- Salad Dressing | Ranch | For Drizzling
- Bacon | 4 slices | Cooked and crumbled
- Chives | 1 tbsp | Chopped

Remove and discard leaves from each cauliflower head, then trim stem so that the cauliflower can lie flat on cutting board. (Leave the core intact!)

Cut each cauliflower into thick “steaks” about 3/4" thick. Reserve any loose florets to cook with the steaks. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, garlic powder, and paprika. Season mixture with salt and pepper.

Heat a grill or grill pan to medium. Brush one side of each steak with olive oil mixture and place the brushed side down on the grill. Brush the top sides with olive oil mixture and cook until tender and both sides are charred in spots, about 8 minutes per side. Top each cauliflower with cheese and cook until melty.

Toss any extra florets in the olive oil mixture and grill, turning often, until charred and tender, about 6 minutes.

Drizzle cauliflower with ranch dressing, then sprinkle cooked bacon and chives on top
