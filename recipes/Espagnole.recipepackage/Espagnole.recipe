- Butter | Unsalted, 8 tbsp | 
- Flour | 1/2 cup | 

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon and lowering the heat as needed to prevent burning, until the roux is several shades darker than peanut butter, 18 to 20 minutes.

- Carrot | 1 | Chopped
- Celery | 1 stalk | Chopped
- Onion | Yellow, 1, small | Chopped

Stir in the carrots, celery and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes.

- Tomato Paste | 1 tbsp | 
- Wine | Dry white, 1/2 cup | 

Stir in the tomato paste, then whisk in the white wine and cook until the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Donâ€™t worry if the vegetables get stuck in the whisk; as you add more liquid, they will release and combine with the sauce.

- Stock | Beef, 8 cups, no sodium | 

Whisk in the stock, 1 cup at a time, and lower the heat to a simmer.

- Black Peppercorns | 1 tsp | 
- Fresh Parsley | Flat leaf, 4 sprigs | 
- Fresh Thyme | 4 sprigs | 
- Bay Leaves | 2 | 

To make a bouquet garni, place the peppercorns, parsley, thyme and bay leaves and in a square of cheesecloth and tie it into a bundle with kitchen twine. Submerge the bouquet garni in the sauce.

Simmer the sauce, using a spoon to skim off any fat or scum that rises to the surface, until it reduces by half and has the consistency of gravy, 30 to 45 minutes.

Remove the bouquet garni, then strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth. Use as desired as a base for sauces.

- Corn Starch |  | 
- Water |  | 

To make a gravy, combine enough corn starch and cold water to make a slurry and whisk into the desired amount of boiling espagnole.
