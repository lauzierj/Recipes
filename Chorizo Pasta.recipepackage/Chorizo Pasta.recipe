- Salt |  | 

Bring 1 gallon of water to boil in a large pot with 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt.

- Olive Oil | 2 tbsp | 
- Onion | Yellow, 1 | Diced

While the water boils, place a large skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Cook the onions for 2-3 minutes, until translucent.

- Chorizo | Fresh Mexican, 1 lb | Removed from casing

Add the fresh chorizo, breaking it up with a wooden spoon and cooking until fully browned (about 5 minutes).

- Pepper | Red Bell, 2 | Diced
- Garlic | 2 Cloves | Minced
- Chipotle Pepper | In Adobo Sauce, 1-2 | Minced
- Paprika | Spanish, 1 tsp | 
- Lemon | 1 | Zested
- Heavy Cream | 3 cups | 
- Tomato Paste | 2 tbsp | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 

Add the red bell pepper, garlic, the chipotle peppers (use 1 or 2 depending on how much spice you like), the paprika, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, the heavy cream, and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a gentle simmer for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. Remove from heat.

- Pasta | Rigatoni, 1 lb | 

Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook 1-2 minutes less than package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.

- Cilantro | 1/2 bunch | Finely minced, more for garnish

Add the cooked pasta to the sauce along with the cilantro and return to the heat for 1-2 minutes, tossing to coat well. Add a little bit of the reserved pasta water to thin the sauce if it seems too thick.

- Cotija | 1 cup | grated
- Black Pepper | Freshly Ground | 

Remove from heat, stir in the cotija cheese, and season with black pepper and additional salt to taste. Garnish with additional cilantro just before serving.
