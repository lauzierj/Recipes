Set oven to 375°F (190°C).

- Garlic | 1 small head | 

Roast garlic for 40–50 minutes until soft and golden. Cool slightly, then squeeze out 5–6 cloves and mash.

- Butter | Unsalted, 1 tbsp | 
- Shallot | 1 small | 

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sauté shallots until golden and translucent, about 2–3 minutes.

- Wine | Sherry, 1–2 tsp | 

Deglaze the pan with wine, scraping up any browned bits.

- Stock | Chicken, 2–3 cups | 
- Roasted Garlic | 5–6 cloves | 
- Soy Sauce | 1 tsp | 
- Miso Paste | 1 tsp | 

Stir in stock, garlic, soy sauce, and miso. Simmer uncovered over medium heat.

Let the sauce simmer gently, reducing by at least half, about 10–20 minutes. Stir occasionally.

- Butter | Unsalted, 1 tbsp | 

Whisk in butter until the sauce is glossy and rich.

> Optional: Strain through a fine mesh sieve for a smooth finish, or leave rustic.
