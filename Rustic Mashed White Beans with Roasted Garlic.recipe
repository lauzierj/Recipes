- Garlic | 1 whole bulb | 
- Olive Oil | 2 tbsp | 
- Salt | Pinch | 

Place the garlic bulb in a small casserole dish, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sprinkle with a pinch of kosher salt. Cover and roast at 375Â°F for 40 minutes, or until the cloves are soft and golden. Let cool, then squeeze out roasted garlic cloves.

- Canned Beans | Great Northern Beans, 1 can (15 oz) | Drained and rinsed
- Canned Beans | Cannellini, 1 can (15 oz) | drained and rinsed
- Fresh Thyme | 1 tsp | 
- Lemon | 1 tbsp | Juiced
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Black Pepper | 1/4 tsp | 
- Olive Oil | 1 tbsp | 

In a skillet over medium heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add both types of beans and the roasted garlic cloves. Stir and warm gently for about 5 minutes. Add thyme, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

Use the back of a wooden spoon to gently smash some of the beans and garlic. Leave most beans whole for a chunky, rustic texture. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve warm.
