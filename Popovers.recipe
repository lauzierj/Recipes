Preheat oven to 450째F (230째C) pan in oven. After preheated, spray pan with cooking spray.

- Milk | 1 1/2 cup | 
- Eggs | 3 large | 
- Salt | 1 tsp | 
- All-Purpose Flour | 1 1/2 cup | 

In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, and salt until well combined. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Then, let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.

Pour batter into the prepared popover pan, filling each cup about 1/2 to 2/3 full.

Place in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350째F (175째C) and continue baking for 15-20 minutes more, until popovers are puffed and golden brown.

Do not open the oven door while the popovers are baking as this can cause them to deflate.

Serve immediately.
