- Mussels | 3-1/2 to 4 lb | 

Rinse the mussels well under cold water. Pick them over, pulling off any beards and discarding any mussels that are broken or gaping open.

- Olive Oil | Extra Virgin, 2 tbsp | 
- Butter | Unsalted, 1 tbsp | 
- Garlic | 6 cloves | Finely chopped
- Shallots | 4 | Thinly sliced
- Crushed Red Pepper Flakes | 1/4 tsp | 

In a large pot with a lid, heat the oil and butter over medium heat. Add the garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant and soft but not colored, 3 to 5 minutes.

- Wine | Dry white, 1-1/2 cups | 
- Fresh Parsley | Flat leaf, 3/4 cup | Chopped

Add the mussels, wine, and half of the parsley. Increase the heat to high, and cover the pan. After 2 minutes, remove the lid and toss the mussels well with a large spoon. Cover the pot again and cook until the mussels have opened wide, another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining parsley, give the mussels a final toss, and divide the mussels and the broth among bowls. Serve the bread alongside.

- Bread | Baguette | Broiled, seasoned, and rubbed with garlic
