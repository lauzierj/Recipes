# Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla Recipe

## Ingredients

- Chicken | Breast, 2, | Seasoned with salt and pepper and grilled until cooked, then sliced
- Black Beans | 1 can (15 ounces) | Rinsed and drained
- Cheese | Monterey Jack, 2 cups | Shredded
- Tortillas | 8, medium-sized | 
- Pepper | Red Bell, 1 | Diced
- Onion | 1 | Diced and sautéed until translucent
- Olive oil | as needed | For brushing the tortillas
- Salt | to taste | 
- Pepper | to taste | 

## Instructions

Preheat your skillet or griddle over medium heat.

Prepare the tortillas by laying them flat. Sprinkle half of each tortilla with a handful of cheese. Add chicken slices, black beans, sautéed onions, and diced bell pepper on top of the cheese. Add more cheese on top, then fold the tortillas in half, pressing lightly to adhere.

Brush the outside of each tortilla with a small amount of olive oil.

Place the prepared quesadillas on the preheated skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the tortillas are golden brown and the cheese has fully melted.

Once cooked, remove the quesadillas from the skillet, allow them to cool for a moment, then slice each into wedges.

Serve the chicken and black bean quesadillas while they're still warm. Enjoy as is, or with your favorite dips and sides.
