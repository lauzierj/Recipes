## Filling

- Ground Beef | 93% lean, 1 lb | 
- Garlic | 3 cloves | Peeled and minced
- Soy Sauce | ¼ cup | 
- Brown Sugar | ¼ cup | 
- Sesame Oil | 2 tsp | 
- Fresh Ginger | 1/2 to 1 tsp | Ground
- Red Pepper Flakes | Pinch | 
- Rice | 2 cups | Cooked
- Green Onions | 3 | Sliced thinly 

Cook the beef and minced garlic in a preheated skillet until the meat turns brown. I cook the beef until it’s dark brown as I want the meat to be a little crunchy

In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, grated ginger (or ground ginger) and red pepper flakes (if using). Replace with paleo-approved ingredients if doing paleo. Use fresh ginger if you can as it adds a lot of flavor (truly a must for this recipe). Pour all the sauce into the beef and mix well. Cook just until everything is heated through

Serve on top of freshly cooked rice. Garnish with sliced green onions. Enjoy.
