# Mint Julep

> Refreshing minty cocktail - perfect for the Kentucky Derby. #cocktail #whiskey

Muddle the mint leaves and simple syrup in the bottom of a rocks glass or julep cup. Be brief and gentle; abrasive muddling will turn the mint bitter.

Add crushed ice and bourbon to the glass, stirring until the glass frosts.

Top with more ice, and serve with a straw and mint sprig to tickle your nose.
