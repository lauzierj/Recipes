Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

- Chicken | Thighs, 1 1/2 lbs, boneless skinless | 
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
- Pepper | 1/2 tsp | 
- Olive Oil | 2 tbsp | 

Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Add the olive oil to the skillet and once itâ€™s hot, add in the chicken. Brown the chicken on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the skillet and place it in the oven, roasting for 20 minutes.

- Ground Cumin | 2 tsp | 
- Paprika | Smoked, 1 tsp | 
- Chile Powder | 1/2 tsp | 
- Garlic Powder | 1/2 tsp | 
- Chipotle Chili Powder | 1/4 tsp | 
- Onion Powder | 1/2 tsp | 

In a bowl, combine the cumin, paprika, chili powders, garlic powder and onion power in a bowl. Set aside.

- Tomatoes | Cherry, 1 cup | Quartered
- Onion | Red, 1/2 | Finely diced
- Cilantro | Fresh, 1/4 cup | Chopped
- Lime | 1 | Juiced

While the chicken is cooking, combine the diced onion, tomatoes, and cilantro in a bowl with the juice of the lime. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Set aside.

- Greek Yogurt | 3 tbsp |

- Adobo Sauce | 1 tbsp, from a can of chipotles |

- Salt | 1/8 tsp | 

In another bowl, whisk together the yogurt, half and half, adobo, lime juice and zest and salt, whisking well to combine. Set aside.

As soon as the chicken is finished cooking, pull it apart with a pair of forks. Return it to the pan making sure all the juice goes with it.

Add in the spices that you mixed before and stir into the chicken for a full minute or two to completely shred it and mix with the spices.

- Tortillas | Corn, 12, Small | 
- Cheese | Cotija, 4 oz | Crumbled

To assemble the tacos, place the chicken in a tortilla and top with the quick salsa, the crumbled cheese and a drizzle of the crema. Serve with avocado on the side or on top and a fresh squeeze of lime.
