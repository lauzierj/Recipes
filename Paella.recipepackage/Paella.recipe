- Shrimp | 1 lb | Peeled and deveined

Start by thawing the shrimp (if frozen). Remove shells and tails (or leave tails on - up to you). Transfer the shrimp to a large bowl and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

- Fresh Parsley | 1/2 cup | Chopped
- Olive Oil | 1 1/2 tsp | 
- Garlic | 1 clove | Minced

Prepare the herb blend by combining the chopped parsley, olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl. Mix to combine and set aside.

- Broth | Chicken, 3 cups | 
- Wine | White, 3/4 cup, spanish | 
- Saffron | 1/2 tsp | 

Combine the broth and wine. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add the saffron, mix well to combine, and reduce heat to low. Cover and gently simmer until needed.

- Olive Oil | 1 tbsp | 
- Chorizo | 2 link | Cut into 1/2” pieces, barely fits

Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 13” paella pan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced sausage and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring as needed (see notes). Remove from pan to a clean plate. Set aside.

Add the shrimp to the pan (add additional olive oil, if needed). Cook shrimp for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until nearly cooked. Remove from the pan to a clean plate. Set aside.

- Onion | Small, 1 | Finely diced
- Pepper | Red, 1 | Finely diced

Reduce heat to medium. Add one more tablespoon of olive oil and add the onions and bell pepper. Mix thoroughly to combine. Cook, stirring often, for 10-15 minutes.

- Garlic | 3 cloves | Minced
- Salt | 3/4 tsp | 
- Tomatoes | 1/2 cup | Diced
- Sweet Paprika | 1/2 tsp | 

Add the salt and garlic, cook for an additional minute before adding the diced tomatoes, and sweet paprika. Cook, stirring often, for an additional 3-5 minutes.

- Rice | Valencia, 1 1/2 cups | 

Add the dry rice to the pan and mix thoroughly with the aromatics. Allow the rice to toast for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- Frozen Peas | 1/2 cup | 

Add the herb mixture, thawed peas, sausage, and slowly add the broth. Mix thoroughly to combine and stir the rice often. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low heat. Stir for approximately 5 minutes then stop stirring for the remainder of the cooking time.

Cook, uncovered for 15 minutes.

- Mussels | 1/2 pound | Steamed in chicken broth, wine, and garlic.

> Some recipes call for covering the paella with foil or steaming the mussels before hand to ensure the mussels open fully.

Nestle the clams, mussels, and shrimp into the rice mixture. Cook for 5-10 minutes, or until shells open (discard any unopened shells). Rotate the pan every few minutes to ensure even cooking.

- Lemon |  | Cut into wedges

Remove from heat and cover with a towel. Allow paella to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges, if desired.
