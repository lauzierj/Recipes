- Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette |  | 

Refrigerate dressing.

- Cilantro | 1/2 cup | 
- Lime | 2 | Juiced
- Salt | 2 tsp | 
- Garlic | 2 cloves | 
- Cumin | 1 tsp | 
- Chili Powder | 1 tsp | 
- Olive Oil | Light, 1/4 cup | 

Using the same blender or processor that the vinaigrette was made in (you don’t need to wash it out), place all ingredients for the marinade inside and puree until garlic is finely chopped.

- Chicken | Breast, 1 lb | 

Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a bowl or Ziploc bag and add chicken to the marinade.

- Onion | 1 | Sliced
- Pepper | Yellow Bell, 1 | Cut into strips

Pour the other half of the marinade into another bag or bowl and add the sliced onion and peppers to it.

> Let marinate overnight or for several hours, if possible. You can also skip letting it marinade and use it immediately. It will still taste great!

Preheat grill on high heat, reduce to medium when screaming hot.

Heat a large sauté pan or wok to high. Add the vegetables (do not add the marinade) to the hot pan and cook quickly, tossing with tongs or a spatula until the veggies are still crisp, but golden brown in spots. Remove from pan and keep warm.

- Romaine | 1 head | Chopped
- Avocado | 1 | Sliced
- Tomatoes | Cherry, 3/4 cup | Halved

Prepare salad plates (or a large bowl) by placing lettuce, avocado sliced, and cherry tomatoes on each plate(or all together in a bowl.

Cook chicken on grill for 10 minutes per side or until done.

Top salads with the hot chicken (sliced) and vegetables. Drizzle with the cilantro lime vinaigrette.
